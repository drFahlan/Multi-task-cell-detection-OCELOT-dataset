[OCELOT dataset](https://lunit-io.github.io/research/ocelot_dataset/) is the dataset that we are using in this research, and is available on the link provided.

# Data acquisition and annotation:
The OCELOT dataset was collected from hundreds of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained Whole-Slide-Images (wSIs) available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. From the slides, extracted 1 to 3 Regions of Interest (RoIs) to become a large FoV. From each large FoV, select 1 RoI inside it with a width of 4 times smaller to become the small FoV pair.

And from the extracted samples, which include large FoVs and their small FoV pair, annotation was performed. A total of 67 board-certified pathologists perform a tissue region annotation on the large FoV and a cell point annotation on the small FoV.
