# Tumor cell detection using small and large FoV

##Overview
This repository is part of our research documentation, which you can access here.

The ocelot dataset is a distinguished dataset that facilitates multiscale cell detection via multitask feature integration. Following the release of the OCELOT dataset, we conduct:
1. Evaluate multiple different feature integration strategies on a consistent cell detection pipeline.
2. Analyze the effect of the feature integration on the cell detection model performance.
