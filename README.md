The ocelot dataset is a distinguished dataset that facilitates multiscale cell detection via multitask feature integration. Following the release of the OCELOT dataset, we conduct:
1. Evaluation of multiple different feature integration strategies on a consistent cell detection pipeline.
2. Analysis of the effect of the feature integration on the cell detection model performance.

## Dataset
In this research, we utilize the [OCELOT dataset](https://lunit-io.github.io/research/ocelot_dataset/). Further explanation regarding the dataset and how we utilize it, see [dataset](https://github.com/drFahlan/Multi-task-cell-detection-OCELOT-dataset/tree/main/dataset).
